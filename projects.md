* [GitHub](https://github.com/discretezoo)

DiscreteZOO is a repository of graphs and other discrete objects. 
Various censuses of graphs and other objects exist on the web.
DiscreteZOO aims to give them a common home, make them easily accessible and searchable according to some precomputed properties.
MathDataHub builds on the ideas from DiscreteZOO.
