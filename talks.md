# Talks

## Do mathematicians dream of data?

I gave a talk at [LMFDB, Computation, and Number Theory (LuCaNT) 2025](https://icerm.brown.edu/program/topical_workshop/tw-25-lucant), 
which took place at [ICERM](https://icerm.brown.edu/) in Providence, July 7 - 11, 2025.

## Lean-HoG: Incorporating a database of graphs into a proof assistant

Together with Jure Taslak, I gave a talk at the workshop [Formalization of Mathematics](https://www.mathematics.uni-bonn.de/him/programs/past/him-trimester-program-prospects-of-formal-mathematics#wrks1), which took place at the Hausdorff Research Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, June 17 - 21, 2024, during the trimester program "Prospects of Formal Mathematics".

## Kako vemo, kaj vemo? (How do we know what we know)

I gave an [outreach talk](https://matematicni-izleti.famnit.upr.si/sl/zgodovina/202223/202223/202223%20vemo/) (in Slovene) about knowledge databases for mathematics and a bit about how they work.
The talk was part of the Alumni week at the University of Primorska (Koper, April 17 - 21, 2023) and part of the outreach talk series [Famnitovi izleti v matematično vesolje 2022/23](https://matematicni-izleti.famnit.upr.si/sl/zgodovina/202223/202223/)
